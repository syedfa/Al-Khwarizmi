Verily all praises is for Allah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whom Allah chooses to guide, none that can mislead him and whom He chooses mislead, none that can guide him. I bear witness that none has the right to be worship except Allah Alone, having no partners, and I bear witness that Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘ alayhi ‘wa sallam (peace and blessings upon him) (saw)) is His slave and His Messenger. 

O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam. Sura 3 - Aal-E-Imran [The Family of Imran] Verse 102

O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and (always) say a word directed to the Right: 
That He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He that obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement. 

Sura 33 - Al-Ahzab [The Clans, the Coalition, the Combined Forces] Verses 70-71

As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the word of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (saw) and the worst of affairs are the novelties and every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is going astray and every going astray is in the Fire (of Hell). I ask Allah to guide us to that which is proper – verily He is the one having authority over that and having power to do so.

Al-Khwarizmi is an inheritance calculator that conforms to the best of its ability to the shari'ah (Islamic Law).  This app is a humble effort by a Muslim developer who is NOT a student of knowledge, but has tried to study the rules of inheritance according to Islam through various means, and has then tried to translate those laws into code.  In Ahlus-Sunnah, we recognize the four schools of thought, and understand that there are subtle differences between these madhahib on this subject as well.  While the developer of this app belongs to the Hambali madh-hab, the app itself most closely conforms to the Hanafi madh-hab for the following two reasons:

1.  Based on research by asking various students of knowledge which opinions were the strongest according to the proofs from the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
2.  Simplicity

The main issue of contention here that I wish to point out to the user is what share does the grandfather take, in the absence of the father?  According to the Hambali madh-hab, and others (and this is also the opinion of 'Umar-May ALLAH be pleased with him), the grandfather gets the larger of the following three options:

1.  Equal share as that of the full brothers
2.  1/6 of the entire estate
3.  1/3 of the residual

According to the Hanafi opinion (and the opinion of Abu Bakr, and other sahabah - May ALLAH be pleased with all of them), the grandfather simply replaces the father altogether in every aspect, including share, as well as residual.  As mentioned earlier, due to the strength of this opinion (and by no means to belittle the other opinion), as well as the ease of implementing this option into code, this option was chosen.

For those who are strict adherents of their respective madh-hab (and there is nothing wrong with this), I do apologize in advance for not being able to implement solutions to meet the requirements of all four schools of thought.  I hope InshaALLAH that in the near future, myself, and/or others will be able to make the necessary enhancements to make this option available.  We ask ALLAH to make this possible, Ameen.

I also wish to point out that this app is by no means a definitive, authoritative guide, and does NOT, in any way whatsoever, replace the scholars, Imams, and students of knowledge that are at our disposal.  This app is merely a tool to be used to help us follow the Qur'an and Sunnah when it comes to rules of inheritance, and not meant to replace the people of knowledge altogether.

ALLAH says in the Holy Qur'an:

"..Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge…" 58:11

and also:

"..So ask of those who know the Scripture if you know not."  16:43

I apologize in advance if for any reason, an error is discovered during its use.  If an error of any kind is found, please bring it to my intention with an explanation of why it is an error, and what you think is the possible solution via email:  fayyazuddin@gmail.com .  I will do my best to respond quickly to address the issue, or perhaps clarify why the results are the way they are.

It is also hoped that by using this app, people will be motivated to study the rules of inheritance more closely, and thus, appreciate the Divine Wisdom behind the rules of inheritance.  In this day and age of Islamophobia, and the countless atrocities committed against Muslims world wide, as well as the numerous polemics that are issued attacking Islam, and the Shari'ah, rather than becoming apologetic, and ashamed of Islam, we should be proud of our religion, and proud of our Shari'ah, as demonstrated by this narration, "Salman al-Fārisī, the Companion from Persia, was told, “Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to use the bathroom.” He responded, “That is right. He ﷺ told us not to…use our right hand when cleaning and to not use less than three stones to clean ourselves after we finish.”  Tirmidhi

With this project, I hope to inspire all Muslims (young and old alike), to work together, and in so doing bring the tremendous skills and resources that are available at our disposal and contribute to the betterment for the Muslim Ummah, whether locally, or globally.  With Muslim business and technology professionals coming together, not only will we be able to have control over our creative freedom, but we will also be in a much stronger position to better cater to the needs of the Muslim community at large, whether it be in the products/services that we provide, or by providing better employment opportunities to our fellow Muslims.  This path is by no means easy, but the rewards that are a consequence of success are too great to ignore.  Our community leaders need to instil this concept of entrepreneurship in our youth, and not simply emphasize the necessity of producing doctors, lawyers, and engineers.  This misplacement of priorities results in benefiting an elite few, who in turn service a minority of the population, and ignores the rest of the community.  It is through entrepreneurship, unity, and innovation, while having the sincere intention to please ALLAH while following the Sunnah, can Muslims bring greater financial independence to the Muslim community than a single profession.

While this effort took a tremendous amount of time, despite the many suggestions to sell the app, even for a paltry amount, I have gone ahead to make the app free of charge, and also have released the source code to the general public (with conditions).  The reason why I have chosen this path is for one reason, and one reason only, and that is, I simply could not reconcile taking a monetary gain (regardless of how small) in order for one to follow the Sunnah.  I simply did not feel right about this.  The Messenger of ALLAH (Peace and Blessings be upon him), the companions, and the countless scholars and students who have come before us have served this religion and made infinitely greater contributions than this small app, without any regard of their own livelihood, nor demanded any worldly benefit, nor fame of any kind.  If any were deserving of such returns, it was them, and if they refused, than whom am I?

That being said, this is not to say that it is wrong for Islamic workers to receive monetary renumeration for their work.  This was simply a personal choice made hopefully with the intention to come closer to ALLAH and hopefully achieve the Mercy of ALLAH, and hopefully avoid the Punishment of ALLAH.

It is also hoped that this app will demonstrate that the Shari'ah is just as relevant now, as it ever was.  The Sunnah is to be studied, and followed at all times, and can never be abrogated, despite the anger, and animosity of the enemies of Islam, and regardless of how eloquent, and convincing their arguments may be.

Finally, the app is named Al-Khwarizmi as homage to the great Muslim mathematician, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al‐Khwārizmī (Born circa 780 Died circa 850).  The reason for this decision was to show that unlike in other religions, and cultures, the knowledge, and guidance of Islam allowed the development, and flourishing of the secular sciences, as opposed to hindering it.  In this case, software development which is an extension of mathematics, a field pioneered by Al-Khwarizmi, and whose very name is the origin of the word, algorithm.  I ask ALLAH to honour the legacy of Al-Khwarizmi, and all other Muslim scholars who are upon the Sunnah, and we ask ALLAH to raise their status in Paradise on the Day of Judgment, Ameen.

Any knowledge or field of study that is undertaken for a purpose other than to glorify, and come closer to ALLAH, to earn HIS Mercy and Forgiveness, and to avoid HIS Anger, and Punishment, is a corrupt intention, and a knowledge that does not benefit.  I conclude with the following hadith:
Zaid ibn Arqam said, "I am not going to say anything except what Allah's Messenger, may peace be upon him, used to say. He used to supplicate, 'O Allah, I seek refuge in You from incapacity, from sloth, from cowardice, from miserliness, from old age, and from the torment of the grave. O Allah, grant my soul righteousness, and purify it, for You are the Best Purifier. You are the Protecting friend, and Guardian. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the knowledge that does not benefit, from a heart that does not fear You, from a soul that is uncontented, and from supplication to which You do not respond." (Muslim)
